### zuri_list_view_task

# This task/assignment will be a summary or life case usage of the concepts and things we learnt this week.



- [x] Follow the ListView Tutorials and write the codes in the tutorial.
- [x] Create a new Activity called "LoginActivity".
- [x] Design a login page in the activity_login.xml file (be creative and be sure to use material design components).
- [x] Connect the LoginActivity to the ListView in the LoginActivity.kt file using intents (so when a user clicks the login/sign in button the screen goes to the ListView screen).
- [x] Run the app to make sure it works in an emulator or actual device.
- [x] Push your code to github.
- [x] Submit link to the project on github.


# NOTE: Make sure you make the LoginActivity you created the launcher activity in the manifest file. And also restrict access to the ListView to a particular email and password.



I AM ROOTING FOR YOU!!!
